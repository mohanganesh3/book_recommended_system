# Book Recommendation System ðŸ“šâœ¨

Welcome to the Book Recommendation System repository! This project uses a collaborative filtering approach to recommend books based on user interactions and preferences, such as ratings or favorites.

# ðŸš€ Key Features

	â€¢	Collaborative Filtering: Recommends books based on interactions from users with similar reading habits.
	â€¢	Popular Book Recommendations: Suggests popular books based on preprocessed data.
	â€¢	Interactive Web Interface: A user-friendly interface for getting book recommendations.

# ðŸ§  How It Works (Collaborative Filtering)

This system uses collaborative filtering, a technique that makes recommendations based on usersâ€™ behaviors and interactions. The primary approach involves:

	1.	User-Item Matrix:
	â€¢	The system uses a pivot table (pt.pkl) containing user-book interactions. Each row represents a user, and each column represents a book, with values indicating whether a user has interacted with a book (e.g., rated it or marked it as a favorite).
	2.	Similarity Computation:
	â€¢	Based on this matrix, the system computes similarity scores between users using techniques like cosine similarity or Pearson correlation. These scores are stored in the similarity_scores.pkl file.
	3.	Recommendation Generation:
	â€¢	Once the similarity between users is known, the system identifies books liked by users with similar preferences and recommends those books to you.
	4.	Popular Books:
	â€¢	In addition to collaborative filtering, the system also provides a list of popular books using preprocessed data from popular.pkl.

# ðŸ”§ Usage

	1.	Web Interface:
	â€¢	Run the Flask app (app.py) and visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser.
	â€¢	The homepage (index.html) shows popular books.
	â€¢	For personalized recommendations, go to /recommend and enter your user ID.
	2.	Jupyter Notebook:
	â€¢	Open book_recommended_system.ipynb to explore the recommendation logic and test the model interactively.
