# Book Recommendation System 📚✨

Welcome to the Book Recommendation System repository! This project uses a collaborative filtering approach to recommend books based on user interactions and preferences, such as ratings or favorites.

# 🚀 Key Features

	•	Collaborative Filtering: Recommends books based on interactions from users with similar reading habits.
	•	Popular Book Recommendations: Suggests popular books based on preprocessed data.
	•	Interactive Web Interface: A user-friendly interface for getting book recommendations.

# 🧠 How It Works (Collaborative Filtering)

This system uses collaborative filtering, a technique that makes recommendations based on users’ behaviors and interactions. The primary approach involves:

	1.	User-Item Matrix:
	•	The system uses a pivot table (pt.pkl) containing user-book interactions. Each row represents a user, and each column represents a book, with values indicating whether a user has interacted with a book (e.g., rated it or marked it as a favorite).
	2.	Similarity Computation:
	•	Based on this matrix, the system computes similarity scores between users using techniques like cosine similarity or Pearson correlation. These scores are stored in the similarity_scores.pkl file.
	3.	Recommendation Generation:
	•	Once the similarity between users is known, the system identifies books liked by users with similar preferences and recommends those books to you.
	4.	Popular Books:
	•	In addition to collaborative filtering, the system also provides a list of popular books using preprocessed data from popular.pkl.

# 🔧 Usage

	1.	Interactive Notebook:
Explore the core logic behind the recommendation system by opening the book_recommended_system.ipynb notebook.
	2.	Web Interface:
Use the Flask web app to get personalized book recommendations (recommend.html). On the homepage (index.html), you can also view popular book recommendations.
